# CSS animation

#### learning point
1. use @keyframes to control intermediate steps of animation effects
2. set up different animation properties for selected elements

#### checked point
1. -webkit- is a CSS vendor prefix (https://www.lifewire.com/css-vendor-prefixes-3466867)
2. animation-duration: alternate reverse animation odd circle to even circle
3. if animation-delay: -5s happens, the animation will act as if it has started from the past
